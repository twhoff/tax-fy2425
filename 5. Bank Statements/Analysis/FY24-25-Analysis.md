## Notes

### Internet Claim Methodology
- Aussie Broadband: $105/month × 9 months = $945
- 65% work use claimed (Thomas remote engineering + Isabelle WFH)
- Remaining months in FY may be on different billing cycle

### Streaming Services Justification (Isabelle)

- Competitor campaigns on streaming platforms
- Cultural moments and content that influences consumer behaviour
- 30% work use is conservative and defensible
