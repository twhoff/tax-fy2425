  How to execute, author, and update Holly workflows on any platform.
  Workflows are declarative YAML files under `workflows/`; this skill is
  the executor contract. Use whenever the user asks to "run", "begin",
  "implement", "commit", "track", "orchestrate", "grind", "review",
  "zero-problems", or otherwise invoke a named workflow, or asks to
  create/update a workflow file.

# Use Workflow

Holly workflows are declarative YAML in `workflows/`. The agent is the
executor — there is no engine that walks the YAML for you. This skill
defines the contract every agent must follow when running, authoring,
or modifying a workflow.

---

## When to invoke this skill

When the user says any of:

- "run the X workflow", "execute X", "begin a session", "implement ISSUE",
  "commit and push", "track TASK", "orchestrate EPIC", "review ISSUE",
  "fix zero-problems"
- "create a new workflow for X", "update the X workflow"
- The user types a slash-command-style invocation that matches a workflow
  file in `workflows/`

Trigger phrases are intentionally broad — when in doubt, list the
workflows in `workflows/*.yaml` and pick the best match by `name` and
`description`. If nothing matches, use `workflows/default.yaml`.

---

## Part 1 — Running a workflow

### Resolve the input

The user's invocation may be one of:

```text
<workflow-name> <issue-id>
<workflow-name> <task description>
<task description>            # no name → match against descriptions, fall back to default.yaml
```

Examples:

- `implement holly-abc` — run [implement.yaml](../../../workflows/implement.yaml) scoped to `holly-abc`
- `orchestrate holly-epic` — run [orchestrate.yaml](../../../workflows/orchestrate.yaml) on an epic
- `review-implementation` — run [review-implementation.yaml](../../../workflows/review-implementation.yaml); preflight figures out scope
- `fix the linting errors` — match → [default.yaml](../../../workflows/default.yaml) with the description as context

### The wrapper sandwich (required execution order)

Every workflow runs **inside** [workflow-wrapper.yaml](../../../workflows/workflow-wrapper.yaml) unless the workflow declares `skip_wrapper: true` (only `end-session.yaml` does this — it IS the teardown path, so wrapping it would be counterproductive).

**Execution order:**

```text
1. Wrapper preflight              workflow-wrapper.yaml → preflight
2. Wrapper hooks.beforeAll        workflow-wrapper.yaml → beforeAll
3. Workflow preflight             target → preflight                  # pass the issue ID / task as context
4. Workflow hooks.beforeAll       target → beforeAll
5. for each step in target.steps:
     Wrapper hooks.beforeEach     workflow-wrapper.yaml → beforeEach
     Workflow hooks.beforeEach    target → beforeEach
     execute step
     Workflow hooks.afterEach     target → afterEach
     Wrapper hooks.afterEach      workflow-wrapper.yaml → afterEach
6. Workflow hooks.afterAll        target → afterAll
7. Workflow postflight            target → postflight
8. Wrapper hooks.afterAll         workflow-wrapper.yaml → afterAll
9. Wrapper postflight             workflow-wrapper.yaml → postflight
```

**Hook scoping:**

- **Wrapper hooks** — run for _all_ workflows; use for minimal universal setup and lightweight guardrails. Workflow-specific status transitions, quality gates, commits, push, teardown, visual proof, and memory work belong in the target workflow. Define wrapper hooks under `hooks:` in [workflow-wrapper.yaml](../../../workflows/workflow-wrapper.yaml).
- **Workflow hooks** — run for _this workflow only_; use for workflow-specific setup (data prep, context initialization) and cleanup (state validation, ephemeral resource removal). Define under `hooks:` in the target workflow YAML.
- **Nesting order** — wrapper hooks **always** wrap outside workflow hooks. The `beforeEach` → `step` → `afterEach` sandwich is: wrapper.before → workflow.before → step → workflow.after → wrapper.after.

This order is non-negotiable. Track every step (preflight, main, postflight, wrapper steps, and all hooks) using `manage_todo_list`. Mark `in-progress` before starting, `completed` immediately after — never batch completions.

### Step execution rules

For each step object:

| Field       | Meaning                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prompt`    | (required) The instruction. Execute it faithfully.                                                                  |
| `delegate`  | If set, delegate to the named sub-agent. If omitted, decide whether to execute directly or delegate.                |
| `category`  | `discovery`, `delivery`, or `quality`; a routing hint, not an automatic delegation mandate.                         |
| `condition` | Natural-language predicate. Skip the step if the condition is not met.                                              |
| `requires`  | Prerequisites that MUST be available. If any is missing, STOP and ask the user.                                     |

### Workflow-specific guardrails

These distil what each per-workflow prompt used to enforce. The full procedure lives in the YAML; these are the cross-cutting rules:

- **begin-session** — Validate session context and tracker readiness, then plan only the context needed for the task. Print a Session Context Snapshot before the plan. Present plan in three formats (snapshot, structured, screen-reader Australian English). Do NOT execute until the user approves. End with a Next Steps panel of 2–5 pasteable suggestions.

- **implement** — TDD discipline (Red → Green → Refactor), with one handoff/commit pass unless the task explicitly needs smaller checkpoints. Accepts an issue/epic ID or task description; auto-creates tracking if needed. Epic mode iterates ALL unblocked children automatically, asking for approval ONCE on the overall plan, not per child. Up to 3 fix cycles on quality-gate failures before escalating.

- **commit** — the `cz` tool is BANNED; generate commitizen-format messages directly. Every commit message must contain a tracker issue ID (the commit-msg hook enforces this). Group changes by issue / epic / project concern — never one-mega-commit. Run schema validation and zero-error policy before pushing. Success = clean tree + up-to-date with origin.

- **end-session** — `skip_wrapper: true`. Archive task, commit any leftovers, file follow-ups, close completed issues, push to remote, transition session to idle. Provide a handoff summary for the next session.

- **track / orchestrate / grind / review-implementation / zero-problems** — refer to each YAML's `description`. Same wrapper sandwich applies.

### Delegation Guidance

Prefer direct execution on the baseline model for ordinary workflow steps. Delegate only when the workflow or user explicitly asks for it, when the task has real parallelism, or when a specialist skill/model is needed for risk, architecture, or domain expertise.

## Part 2 — Authoring a new workflow

### Required structure

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../schemas/workflow.schema.json

name: <Workflow Name> # Title Case
description: <what this workflow accomplishes>

preflight:
  - prompt: <step description>

steps:
  - prompt: <step description> # at least 1 step required (minItems: 1)

postflight:
  - prompt: <step description>
```

`additionalProperties: false` — no extra fields allowed at any level. The schema is the source of truth: `schemas/workflow.schema.json`.

### Step properties

- `prompt` (required, string) — clear, actionable instruction
- `category` (optional) — `discovery` | `delivery` | `quality`
- `delegate` (optional) — `Starbug` | `Haiku Worker` | `Sonnet Worker` | `Opus Worker`
- `condition` (optional, string) — natural-language predicate; step is skipped if not met
- `requires` (optional, array of strings) — prerequisites that must be available

### Optional Jest-style hooks

Under `hooks:` — each value is a step object with the same properties as above:

- `beforeAll` — runs once before the first main step
- `beforeEach` — runs before each main step
- `afterEach` — runs after each main step
- `afterAll` — runs once after the last main step

### Naming convention

- File: `workflows/<kebab-case-name>.yaml`
- `name` field: Title Case

### Wrapper integration

The wrapper provides minimal universal preflight (session init, tracker readiness, AGENTS.md, intent registration, worktree check) and a lightweight postflight reminder. Your workflow's preflight/postflight should contain workflow-specific status transitions, quality gates, commits, push, teardown, visual proof, and memory work.

If a workflow IS itself the teardown path (like `end-session`), set `skip_wrapper: true` at the top level. Otherwise leave the wrapper engaged.

### Validation

After creating the file:

```bash
holly validate
pytest
```

Fix any validation or test errors before considering the work complete.

### Update the orchestrator routing table

When adding a new workflow, also update the workflow table in the project's orchestrator agent definition (typically `.agents/agents/orchestrator-v2.agent.md` or `.agents/agents/orchestrator.agent.md`) with the new workflow's file path and selection criteria.

---

## Part 3 — Updating an existing workflow

Before modifying:

1. **Read the target workflow** — understand its current structure and intent.
2. **Read comparable bundled workflows** (under the active adapter package's `workflows/` or the holly core `workflows/` for generic ones) to keep structure consistent.
3. **Re-read [workflow-wrapper.yaml](../../../workflows/workflow-wrapper.yaml)** — never duplicate wrapper functionality in the workflow.

Apply the same step-property rules and validation steps as authoring a new workflow.

---

## Adapter awareness

This skill is adapter-agnostic. Tracker-specific CLI verbs (find-ready-work, claim, close, sync, etc.) live in [issue-tracker/SKILL.md](../issue-tracker/SKILL.md) and the adapter addendum installed alongside it. When a workflow step says "find the next ready issue" or "close the issue", consult the active adapter's addendum for the concrete command.

The wrapper-sandwich and the workflow YAMLs themselves are also adapter-flavoured: each adapter package ships its own `workflows/begin-session.yaml`, `end-session.yaml`, `implement.yaml`, `commit.yaml`, and `workflow-wrapper.yaml`. `holly skills sync` and `holly workflows sync` install the active adapter's flavour into `<project>/workflows/`. Treat the local YAMLs as the source of truth at runtime.
