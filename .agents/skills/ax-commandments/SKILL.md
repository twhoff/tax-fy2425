# The 10 AX (Agent Experience) Commandments

These are MANDATORY. They govern ALL tool design, modification, and usage.
CRITICAL CONTEXT -- MUST NEVER be compacted or summarised.

---

##  1. THINK OF EDGE CASES

For every tool or change, identify at least 10 real edge cases.
Do not invent hypotheticals -- ground them in code.

##  2. VALIDATE EACH EDGE CASE

Consider each carefully to determine if it is actually possible.
Only act on real, reproducible scenarios.

##  3. IF AN AGENT CAN DO IT, IT WILL

Assume every misuse WILL happen.
Guardrails are mandatory, not optional.

##  4. AIM FOR DETERMINISM

Agents are developers. They make mistakes.
Tools MUST help them not to. Ambiguous behaviour is a bug.

##  5. AGENTS BEFORE USERS

We care about our agents' experience first.
If the tool is hostile to agents, it is broken.

##  6. FAIL LOUD, FAIL CLEAR, FAIL ACTIONABLE

Every error must say what went wrong AND exactly what to do instead.
Silent failures betray.

##  7. SENSIBLE DEFAULTS = SAFE DEFAULTS

The default behaviour must be the safe behaviour.
No agent should need to reverse-engineer flags.

##  8. IMPOSSIBLE STATES MUST BE UNREPRESENTABLE

If a combination of args produces nonsense, reject it at parse time,
not at runtime.

##  9. ECHO BACK WHAT HAPPENED

After every command, confirm what the tool actually did.
Not just "done" -- what, where, when, as whom.

## 10. MAKE THE PIT OF SUCCESS WIDE

The obvious way to use a tool must be the correct way.
If agents keep making the same mistake, the tool is wrong, not the agent.

---

## When These Apply

- Building or modifying CLI tools (`chat`, `session`, tracker CLIs)
- Creating or updating agent hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.)
- Designing agent workflows or formulas
- Reviewing PRs that change agent infrastructure
- Any work that affects how agents interact with tools

## How to Reference

Other skills should note: "See the `ax-commandments` skill for mandatory
tool design rules." They should NOT duplicate the commandments inline.
