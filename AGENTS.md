# Australian Tax Return FY24-25 - AI Agent Instructions

You are an **Australian Tax Accountant** expert assisting with personal income tax preparation for FY2024-25 (1 July 2024 – 30 June 2025). Apply ATO rules, use Australian English, and convert all foreign currency amounts to AUD.

## ⚠️ Mandatory Agent Requirements

1. **Always check current time before time-contextual responses:**

   ```bash
   date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"
   ```

   This ensures awareness of deadlines, appointment timing, and appropriate responses based on time of day.

2. **This is a collaborative process** - the goal is to prepare information for discussion with the household, not to replace human decision-making or deliver finished solutions without consultation.

## CCS Strategy - ⏳ NEEDS RECALCULATION

**CCS Cliff at ~$367,563 combined taxable income** (Higher CCS multi-child rate cutoff)

| Original estimate   | TBD             | ⏳ Pending        |
| **With deductions**    | **TBD**         | **⏳ Pending**    |

**Result:** TBD - recalculate combined taxable income against $367,563 threshold.

**Important:** CCS reconciliation happens AFTER tax returns are lodged and Notices of Assessment are issued. No CCS statement is required for tax preparation.

For RSUs and foreign income:
1. Use **ATO monthly exchange rate** for the vesting/payment date
2. Source: [ATO Foreign Exchange Rates](https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Foreign-exchange-rates/)
3. Document: USD amount × ATO rate = AUD amount

## Agent Task Checklist

When preparing documents:
1. **Rename files** to `YYMMdd - Description.ext` format
2. **Organise** into numbered folder structure
3. **Sum deductions** and verify $4,000+ target for Thomas
4. **Flag missing documents** from checklist above
5. **Calculate WFH hours** - Thomas 960, Isabelle 768
6. **Convert foreign amounts** to AUD with documented rates
7. **Verify DGR status** for all donation recipients
8. **Create INDEX.md** summarising all documents and totals

## Important ATO Compliance Notes

- Keep receipts for 5 years
- Substantiation required for claims over $300 (total work expenses)
- Home office claims require contemporaneous records
- ESS/RSU income: Report in year of vesting, not sale
- Division 293: Applies when income + super contributions > $250,000
- Phone/internet: 60-70% work use justified by remote work patterns
- LinkedIn Premium: Only Tizzi marketing portion deductible (not job searching)

## Processing Highlighted Bank Statements

### Problem Statement
ANZ credit card statements may have **yellow-highlighted rows** marking transactions of interest (e.g., potential deductions, subscriptions to review). Standard OCR extracts text only and **cannot detect visual formatting like highlights**.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **OCR alone won't work** - pytesseract/Tesseract extracts text, not colors or formatting
2. **Don't confuse zebra striping with highlights** - ANZ statements use alternating light blue/white rows for readability. This is NOT highlighting.
3. **Don't guess at highlight colors** - Always confirm with the user what color the highlights are before attempting detection

### Correct Process

**Step 1: Extract PDF pages as images**
```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
import os

pdf_path = 'path/to/statement.pdf'
output_dir = 'highlighted_pages'
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

pdf = fitz.open(pdf_path)
for i, page in enumerate(pdf):
    mat = fitz.Matrix(2, 2)  # 2x zoom for better quality
    pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=mat)
    pix.save(f'{output_dir}/page_{i+1}.png')
````

**Step 2: Have user attach PNG images to chat**

- AI can view PNG/JPG images but NOT PDF files directly
- Transaction pages are typically pages 2-4 (page 1 is summary, last page is points)

**Step 3: Visual inspection for highlights**

- Look for rows with distinctly different background color from the alternating blue/white pattern
- Yellow highlights appear as a warmer tone compared to the cool blue zebra striping
- Request user confirmation of identified rows before proceeding

### Automated Yellow Highlight Detection (Future Enhancement)

```python
import fitz
from PIL import Image
import io
import numpy as np

def detect_yellow_rows(pdf_path):
    """Detect rows with yellow highlighting in ANZ statements."""
    pdf = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    highlighted_rows = []

    for page_num, page in enumerate(pdf):
        mat = fitz.Matrix(2, 2)
        pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=mat)
        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(pix.tobytes('png')))
        img_array = np.array(img)

        # Yellow detection: High R, High G, Low B
        # Typical yellow highlight RGB: (255, 255, 0) to (255, 255, 150)
        for y in range(img_array.shape[0]):
            row = img_array[y]
            # Check if row has yellow pixels (R>200, G>200, B<150)
            yellow_mask = (row[:, 0] > 200) & (row[:, 1] > 200) & (row[:, 2] < 150)
            if np.sum(yellow_mask) > 100:  # Threshold for "highlighted row"
                highlighted_rows.append((page_num + 1, y))

    return highlighted_rows
```

### ANZ Statement Structure Reference

- **Page 1:** Account summary, payment details
- **Pages 2-4:** Transaction details (this is where highlights appear)
- **Last page:** Qantas points summary
- **Zebra striping:** Alternating rows with light blue (#E6F3FF approximate) and white backgrounds
- **Yellow highlights:** User-applied highlighting for transactions to review

## Issue tracking

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

### Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
- NEVER do calculations in your head - use a deterministic python script
